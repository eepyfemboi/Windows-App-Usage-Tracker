# Windows-App-Usage-Tracker
a python app usage tracker for windows that probably wont work very well and is mostly based on chatgpt until i figure out what im doing

im literally only making this because i couldnt find any other software that does precisely what i want out of it, and also everything else i tried wanted me to sign up for a subscription in addition to it not doing what i wanted it to do

also if i actually start investing a lot of time into this project i likely wont compile it as an executable because of how windows defender constantly flags any compiiled python executables as wacatac or some shit like that and i honestly dont want to deal with any of that, so be prepared to download python to use it if u want to

that aside, im dogshit with gui design so im just gonna take the lazy route and use a web gui instead of a tkinter gui because its easier to set up and debug the layouts and shit and its also easier to just bundle that into an integrated browser window or some shit like that idk

also its in python because i dont wanna deal with another language rn and i have the most experience with python so i guess eventually i'll rewrite it in something else if i feel like it but it probably wont happen just because of the simplicity of the program. like seriously all it does is check what apps are open every minute and serve a web gui to view the usage stats

im probably gonna put the actual code in the `real_prototype_1` folder for now i guess since its cleaner than just putting it in the base folder and it makes it easier to manage different versions

last thing: dont judge my code quality. beggars cant be choosers. dont send issues send patches.
